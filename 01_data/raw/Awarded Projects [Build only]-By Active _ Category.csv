Spinach,Mainnet,Applications,http://spinach.fi/,"Spinach helps projects and chains grow DEX liquidity by running liquidity competitions for builders within their ecosystem.  Spinach started in response to witnessing flaws in two leading ecosystem growth methods: 1. Grant funding for builders - works great at first, but many builders struggle to secure follow-up funding 2. Liquidity incentives (e.g. merkl.xyz) - work too well. Whales bridge over to farm incentives, but vanish within 48 hours once incentives stop  To sustainably bind users and liquidity providers to your ecosystem you need to go beyond these growth methods. Enter Spinach’s retrofunding liquidity competitions for builders.  Using Spinach you can launch competitions as follows: 1. Choose token whose liquidity you want to grow 2. Allocate a daily incentive budget 3. Announce to projects they can get part of this incentive budget by orchestrating liquidity against their token and the incentivized token 4. Projects then rally their community to grow this liquidity 5. On a daily basis at midnight, Spinach calculates the liquidity orchestrated per participating project; and 6. Then retroactively distributes rewards to the projects proportional to the liquidity they orchestrated per day  In early testing, we found Spinach has 3 benefits over direct liquidity incentives: 1. Noise machine - projects and their communities actively promote the competition 2. Core community - participants are true fans of your ecosystem and are here for the longterm 3. 2nd-order effects - projects often launch direct liquidity incentive programs of their own  This creates a positive-sum flywheel where everyone wins—the chain, its builders, the community, and the broader ecosystem.  In Q2 ‘25 we’ll launch Spinach MVP to allow anyone to launch liquidity competitions for builders.",$70000.00,$70000.00,"No specific region of operation,North America (without Mexico),Europe & Central Asia",Spinach,Liquid retrofunding that grows DEX TVL,,,SCF #35,SCF #35,"Yes, fully open-source with Github",https://github.com/SpinachFi/spinach/,,https://x.com/spinachfi,,https://spinach.fi/comingsoon,,"Garm, Co-Founder & CEO, is a seasoned product leader with a track record of building innovative fintech and Web3 ventures.

Juntta: Web3 Crowdfunding for LATAM,Development,Applications,https://juntta.org,"Juntta is the first transparent crowdfunding platform built in Peru, addressing the trust gap in digital fundraising across Latin America.

After winning the Stellar Ideathon 2025, we developed a working prototype that connects traditional payment methods with a blockchain-ready backend. With SCF Build, Juntta will integrate the Stellar network to bring full on-chain transparency to donations and fund management. Each contribution will trigger a transaction on Stellar, generating a verifiable record stored in the public ledger and displayed on a real-time dashboard. Smart contracts built on Soroban will escrow donations, automate milestone-based releases, and record fund movement between wallets. A custom API layer will index blockchain data, synchronize it with Juntta’s Web2 interface, and allow third parties—such as NGOs or CSR programs—to connect seamlessly.

AI Transparency Token (AITT),Development,Infrastructure & Services,https://ethixia.com/,"AITT is an open-source solution that certifies the compliance of artificial intelligence systems using the Stellar Soroban blockchain. With the rise of regulations such as the AI Act and GDPR, businesses must demonstrate their commitment to ethics, transparency, and data protection. AITT automates this process by providing an immutable blockchain-based certification registry.    Through its REST API, companies can submit their compliance audits, which are then stored as tamper-proof certificates on the blockchain. Certifications are generated via Soroban smart contracts, issuing non-transferable NFTs to ensure authenticity and prevent falsification. These contracts also enable automatic updates and revocations of certifications if non-compliance is detected in a new audit.    An interactive dashboard allows regulators, investors, and businesses to query the blockchain in real-time to verify certification status. The use of Stellar Soroban ensures optimal scalability and low transaction costs, making adoption accessible to companies of all sizes. This approach eliminates complex manual audits and guarantees a transparent and automated monitoring system for AI compliance.",$74000.00,$49333.33,Europe & Central Asia,AI Transparency Token (AITT),Certification for Ethical Compliance,,,"SCF #34 , SCF #36",SCF #36,"Partly, I do have a public Github",https://github.com/Falparis/AITT,,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLe8CgLCrRAJyv3i_ONP_woBSrBZ8SZfRPiO061sn_Q/edit?tab=t.0,,"1.

The Stellar DeFi Dune Dashboards will change this by providing fully verifiable, on-chain data from smart contract activity. These dashboards will track important stats like Weekly and Monthly Active Users, Average Slippage on Trades, Percentage of Aggregated Trades, and Liquidity Provider Activity. For AMMs and aggregators, we will show key insights, including trade volume, slippage, price impact, and how often trades go through aggregators instead of single AMMs. We will also track arbitrage profits and how many trades are related to arbitrage.

Loam, which has largely been integrated into scaffold-stellar, contains loamstorage (https://github.com/loambuild/loam/blob/main/crates/loam-sdk-macro/src/subcontract/storage.rs), a storage management framework. This project builds upon this functionality by introducing additional tools for storage management, composable error handling, and contract authorization testing:  loamstorage consolidates the storage interface into one type, removing boilerplate and focusing on what is being stored. It introduced storage collections which handle the key definitions, ensuring their uniqueness. We propose contractstorage which will expand on this foundation: including macros enabling shorter key names reducing storage costs without sacrificing readability, mechanisms for automatically minimizing key sizes to optimize ledger efficiency, and composable storage patterns that promote modular contract design while ensuring unique storage keys.  scerr, a framework for composable error propagation across contracts. Currently errors are manually assigned a number. If they are imported from different sources and are assigned the same one, when the contract fails it will be unclear which one was the cause. Our solution will ensure that each error is assigned a unique number, even those from cross contract calls.  We also plan to improve authorization flow testing. Currently when writing tests developers must handcraft a mock authorization entry before making a contract call. We propose a new contract client which will handle both authorizing and making contract calls.  soroban-sdk-tools will enhance developer productivity, reduce on-chain resource consumption, and foster consistency in contract implementations.

Bevor,Development,Developer Tooling,https://bevor.io,"BevorAI is the AI co-pilot for smart contract security - an API and platform that integrates across development, devops, chat, and auditing lifecycles. Think, ""Wiz for Web3"". Both auditing firms and development teams use BevorAI to auto-detect vulnerabilities, streamline their development and auditing, model on-chain risk, and speed up audit delivery We have strong plans to integrate Rust in order to support the growing Soroban and Stellar ecosystem. Auditing Rust contracts is extremely important to allow this ecosystem to grow safely. As more institutions and teams adopt Rust-based smart contracts for their security and performance benefits, the need for specialized automated security tooling becomes critical. Without robust auditing infrastructure, the Rust smart contract ecosystem risks experiencing the same growing pains that plagued earlier blockchain platforms. Our roadmap prioritizes building comprehensive Rust security analysis to ensure teams can build confidently and scale safely on Stellar.",$102000.00,$34000.00,No specific region of operation,Bevor,Collaborative AI Security for Stellar,,,SCF #40,SCF #40,"Partly, I do have a public Github",https://github.com/Bevor-Protocol,,https://x.com/BevorAI_Agent,,https://app.bevor.io/analytics,,"Blake Hatch | CEO & Co-Founder:  
I earned my Computer Science degree from Northeastern University and have always been fascinated by low-level systems engineering. I founded Viridian Exchange, a venture-backed RWA marketplace for which I personally built all smart contracts, before advancing to lead Web3 initiatives at a Fortune 100-backed venture studio. My technical expertise expanded working on remote execution and caching infrastructure for the Bazel monorepo build system, where I honed my systems engineering skills in Rust and became a contributor to Google's open-source Bazel codebase. Most recently, I built out a Kubernetes cluster alongside an L6 engineer from Apple, successfully landing a deal with Samsung for the technology that dramatically reduced their CI/CD times from 3 days to just 1-2 hours.

Peter Simone | CTO & Co-Founder:  
I began my career in biomedical engineering, focusing on genomics and predictive modeling for cancer diagnostics. I then went on to get my M.S. in Data Science from NYU. I worked as a Data Scientist in industry in fintech, insurance, and then led the AI initiatives at a F100 backed venture studio. Since then, I've been more solely focused on SWE. I've been proud of building out money movement flows in fintech startups that helped facilitate over $20M in asset transfers. All of this has given me a strong background in product, data, and software development.

Confidential Transfers and Balances,Development,Developer Tooling,https://www.fairblock.network/,"Fairblock is building compliant, confidential transfers and balances using multimodal cryptography (MPC-IBE, HE, ZK). We build developer tooling and applications that span across various privacy use cases. Two flagship use cases are confidential stablecoins and protected trading.  1. Confidential stablecoins (our primary focus on Stellar): Jay Geng’s talk on Confidential Tokens at Meridian captured the direction and outcome we are shipping. We encrypt transfer amounts and balances so users get bank-like privacy and better execution: lower slippage, no frontrunning, tighter quotes, less market impact of large orders.  2. Protected trading: Encrypted limit orders, intents, and bids with conditional decryption after settlement. What users get is protection from manipulation (e.g. frontrunning) caused by onchain information leakage across trading, lending, predictions, and intents markets.  We build dev tooling so teams can add privacy without reinventing the cryptography. We’ve also shipped applications like encrypted limit orders with CowSwap, our own predictions app with encrypted bids called Time Machine, and are working with teams like Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Noble, Anoma, Uniswap, and Squid.  Our approach is to use the right cryptographic tool for the right job to ensure it’s performant, secure, and compliant (via selective disclosure). Privacy builds trust with both retail and institutional users. If strategies, balances, and invoices remain public onchain, adoption will always hit a ceiling. We envision privacy that’s verifiable and selective is how payments and RWAs will scale.",$150000.00,$50000.00,North America (without Mexico),Confidential Transfers and Balances,Private & compliant payments on Stellar,,,SCF #40,SCF #40,"Partly, I do have a public Github",https://github.com/Fairblock,https://discord.com/invite/fairblock,https://x.com/0xfairblock,https://www.linkedin.com/company/fairblock/,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQNzqdy-mp67RWCr_4lE6cbMg6EaF5EUjcqY97fBKEJCkTKLR2L6cSnS6bnAoJQNT1zeV3_t3LFVULc/pubhtml?gid=1715037745&single=true,,"1.

The solution helps buyers optimize their working capital and provide SMEs with the funds they need prior to payment from the buyer, regardless of whether they have a direct relationship with the buyer.    The platform leverages credit from large buyers through tokenizing their account receivables on Stellar and fractionalizing them into smaller ones representing amounts owed to individual suppliers. Consequently, associated suppliers can obtain factoring services for a given account receivable, based on which they can secure advanced stablecoin loans equal to what will be owed them by the buyer. This process enables up to 10 suppliers associated with an account receivable to obtain credit lines so they can secure working capital.

The team is led by Adedotun Akintayo, who holds a Ph.D. specializing in Numerical Algorithms and Applied ML. With extensive experience as an AI/ML Software Engineer & Tech Lead at Boeing, he brings profound technical expertise and strategic insight to his role as co-founder and business lead at LiquidsFi. His background in developing distributed computing, numerical analysis, and AI-driven tools and frameworks, combined with a proven track record in product development and project management, equips him to effectively lead the team in achieving LiquidsFi's mission.

  

The team has done significant work on developing decentralized applications and protocols on several blockchains, both EVM and non-EVM ones like Soroban, Solana and Polkadot. These include the development of a multi-chain algorithmic money market (AMM) where users can take out over-collateralized loans using both tangible and intangible assets like NFTs. It is one of the few AMMs that supports the use of whitelisted NFTs in a permissionless manner as collateral. Another major achievement is the development of an NFT on-chain liquidity reserve. This protocol is designed to give NFTs of GameFi projects intrinsic value, making it possible to build LP DEXs and atomic swaps for NFTs, which was not possible before. And more recently, the team developed a stablecoin bridge protocol that uses a lock and release mechanism for asset transfer and leverages the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and an in-house decentralized oracle mechanism to transfer assets. This protocol supports the bridging of stablecoins (testnet) across multiple EVM chains, and the team is now working on expanding it to non-EVM chains.

  

With these accomplishments, the team is now focused on interoperability solutions, which involve bridging Soroban and Stellar Lumen to tens of EVM chains in a secure and decentralized approach.

Lobster,Mainnet,Financial Protocols,https://www.lobster-protocol.com/,"Lobster is a liquidity pool optimization platform designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It enables DEXs to increase their liquidity efficiency, improve their rankings on aggregators, and boost trading volumes, ultimately driving more revenue.  Lobster addresses the “liquidity pool trilemma” that many DEXs struggle with. It provides a comprehensive dashboard that evaluates three key metrics for each liquidity pool:  Efficiency: How attractive is the pool to traders? Profitability: Is the pool competitive for liquidity providers? Stability: Does the pool maintain stable prices without being overtaken by arbitrageurs?  With Lobster, DEXs can run LP-specific algorithms based on real-time data to optimize pool performance. This results in better liquidity management, enhanced pool attractiveness, and higher overall volume. The platform’s data-driven approach empowers DEXs to make informed decisions and adapt quickly to market conditions, improving liquidity provision in a less risky and more profitable manner.

Stablecoins today move billions in payments, but their application in conventional credit markets remains limited at best. Most crypto lending revolves around token leverage, while traditional credit remains tied to opaque and systems and outdated legacy infrastructure.  Indentura is a protocol that allows borrowers to pledge high-quality offchain collateral and access stablecoin credit lines from a global onchain liquidity pool. We combine DeFi-native liquidity with offchain infrastructure that gives lenders enforceable legal claims and real-time visibility into pledged collateral, while preserving borrower privacy.  Our initial product enables specialty finance companies to receive a stablecoin revolving credit facility to fund small and medium sized businesses businesses in fiat. These credit lines are essential for managing cash flow, but are rarely available outside the banking system. By reallocating idle funds into short-duration DeFi yield sources until drawn, we eliminate cash drag and make revolving facilities viable for non-bank lenders to access for the benefit of their clients.  This is the first step toward a broader credit system built around programmable liquidity. Over time, Indentura will support SME lending, embedded fintech credit, consumer borrowing, and onchain structured products.

Legasi,Development,Financial Protocols,https://www.legasi.io/,"Legasi is building the first on-chain Lombard lending infrastructure, replicating the private banking model of asset-backed credit, designed for institutional use. It enables investors and enterprises to borrow stablecoins or fiat against crypto and tokenized RWAs, bringing long-term, capital-efficient financing to the blockchain in a transparent, programmable, and fully compliant way.  Through a dedicated lending SPV refinanced by institutional liquidity providers, Legasi connects compliant capital with blockchain-based collateral pools. Collateral remains non-custodial and auditable on-chain, while conversion to fiat is facilitated off-chain by regulated PSPs and EMEs such as Circle, ensuring full AML/KYC compliance and seamless TradFi ↔ DeFi interoperability.  Unlike short-term, leverage-driven crypto-backed loans, Legasi provides multi-year financing with stable and competitive rates, focused on capital preservation rather than speculation. Its progressive liquidation mechanism enhances safety by avoiding abrupt liquidations and preserving collateral value, which is key to institutional risk standards.  Aligned with Stellar’s mission to bridge TradFi and DeFi, Legasi delivers the credit layer for tokenized assets. By leveraging USDC and EURC on Stellar, the protocol enables cross-border, real-time settlement of Lombard loans and establishes a scalable, compliant RWA credit market within the Stellar ecosystem.  Legasi’s long-term vision is to make every tokenized asset bankable on-chain, bringing the trust and precision of traditional finance into the open, interoperable world of Stellar.

Brief Summary:  

Venerez is a platform that conforms to all regulatory requirements — and is focused on partnering with regulated financial institutions and governments of emerging economies pursuing digital transformation.  

Most regulated financial institutions require partners to assume full financial and regulatory liabilities. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for early-stage financial projects to bear the costs of providing hard warranties or liability coverage—especially given the risks of malicious actors, copycats, or unauthorized modifications. To reduce exposure to much higher compliance and insurance costs, and to ensure team safety (due to the sensitive nature of our work), we do not specifically disclose team members involved in the project.  

Underlining our members & their expertise: there are 6 internal members and 4 external team members on the Venerez Team. All are ready for immediate engagement.  

4 with over 15 years of full-stack development and engineering experience, including financial application development for both traditional finance and crypto platforms (e.g., tokenized exchange cores). Skilled in Scala, Java, Python, C/C++, and Rust.

  
2 with over 6 years of full-stack development experience.  

All 4 external team members are experienced in blockchain migration and development, including crypto wallets, exchanges, and tokenization tools.  

Specialising in all features required to deliver:

- tokenized exchanges

- search engine

- CRM

The team has a combined 30+ years of experience of which most of it in the development of blockchain application.  

The development team have extensive experience building  blockchain dApps, smart contracts both in blockchains that uses a Rust based language like Soroban, Polkadot and Solana, and to Solidity based blockchains.  Their work spans designing, architecting,  coding, and testing both smart contract, front-end and the integration of both.

Some of the past work of the team members include the development of a proxy-like upgradeable smart contract on Soroban, this was developed as a reusable contract library that can be implemented on specific smart contracts. Others include the development of NFT marketplace, development of a DAO mechanism, decentralized p2p marketplace for tangible tokens and many more

We believe that the teams vast experience in architecting ideas, developing smart contracts both in Rust and solidity,, developing user-centered frontends and in the integration of both the smart contract with the frontends using SDKs make us a strong team that would make SoroStarter a successful project.  

The business side is not left out, the experience of our co-founder in affiliate-like marketing inspired the design of SoroStarter’s go-to-market and adoption strategy and in addition to this, we continually collaborate with outside developers and business/marketing specialist as we continue to develop and grow SoroStarter.

We have a proven track record of past collaboration at TU Wien and Informal Systems and as independent contractors, that is, both in an academic environment as well as in the blockchain industry. As part of larger teams, we have been building products such as the Apalache model checker, the Atomkraft model-based testing tool, and the Quint specification language. We have a solid experience of working independently and remotely. In addition to that, we are all located in Vienna (Austria), which makes it possible for us to coordinate offline, when needed. Our combined work experience spans TU Wien: Vienna University of Technology (Austria), Inria Nancy (France), Google (USA), and Informal Systems (Canada/Switzerland/Austria). Together we have strong expertise in applied and fundamental formal methods research; development of verification, testing, and security tools; software engineering; software & network security; and blockchain security audits. In formal methods, we have academic and industry experience in modeling and verification of distributed and concurrent systems, design of model checking algorithms and satisfiability checking procedures. Our expertise and independence from any company guarantees our ability to achieve the stated goals, thus adding resiliency to the project.",checked,5522cf5e (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/50/50/1771912800000/uHrp8mT-Ap99RGHQvr6oew/j8m9boWBUftq8WwmyLw5Ys7HnMgbejzWOWWZoBDLjLOgpAVFRwALT9-ThxgXT0_3-mX3sKmmV4ZGyoLvS0_gOT9vjGnc8pak9P1-X0mvamNnSfnQTg7j_ery7i4Hy9HbpMthKKpICQr7PUBAYyY-XA/eLwAqrKTmDKmoa-TGj5fB8gL4TLXhLA2A57RpqMiTsU)

Our Vision

What excites us most about this project is how it has expanded our vision of what is possible with Soroban Smart Contracts. We don't want to stop here; we aim to explore how we can bridge the gap between real-world needs and smart contract technology. Our ideas range from building no-code smart contract generators (a potential long-term goal after we learn further with our current project) to simpler solutions such as standardizing smart contract building blocks and enabling variable customization through intuitive forms, allowing users to create and deploy contracts easily with just their wallets. We are thoroughly enjoying this journey and are excited to envision the future possibilities ahead.
